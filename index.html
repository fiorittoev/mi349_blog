                As I mentioned on my about page, I collect retro games. But collecting them and actually playing them are two very different 
                things. Over the years, I’ve built up a decent library of titles, many of which I’ve started but never finished. Some I haven’t
                 even touched. Recently, I decided to put a stop to that cycle by making a rule for myself: no buying new games until I’ve made 
                 serious progress on the ones already in my backlog.
                The problem is, I don’t exactly make it easy on myself. Most of the games I choose to play fall into two categories: 
                long RPGs or brutally difficult titles. Sometimes, they’re both. An RPG can easily eat up dozens of hours, while a tough
                 platformer or action game will have me repeating the same section over and over until I finally get it right.
                  That combination makes it really hard to stay consistent, and more than once I’ve put a game down for “a short break” that 
                  ends up lasting months.
                Still, when I do manage to push through and finish one, it feels amazing. 
                Beating a game that challenged me for weeks, or even months, makes it all worth it.

            <h2>Tips for Living with a Cat with Roomates</h2>

            <p>
                I’ve recently been thinking about bringing my cat up to my apartment here at Michigan State. His name is Glooby, 
                and he’s a five-year-old tuxedo cat who has been part of my life for quite a while now. Glooby isn’t just an ordinary
                pet. He has a personality that makes him stand out in the best way. He’s sassy, stubborn, and always makes his opinions known.
                If something isn’t going his way, he’ll flick his tail dramatically or let out a sharp meow that sounds almost like he’s yelling at me.
                At the same time, he has a softer side. He’ll curl up on my lap when I’m studying late into the night, or paw at my hand when he feels like I should be giving him more attention instead of focusing on my laptop.
                Deciding to bring him here feels like a pretty big step, but it’s also really exciting. I know Glooby would make my apartment feel more like home and bring some comfort during stressful weeks of classes and exams.
                Taking care of him will definitely add some responsibility on top of everything else I already have going on, but I honestly think the companionship and joy he’d bring would make my time at MSU much better.
